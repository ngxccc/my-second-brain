## CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: ALWAYS INITIALIZE & FOLLOW TODO

- **Mandatory Todo Initialization**: For any non-trivial or multi-step task, you MUST immediately initialize a phased todo list using the `todo` tool, or extract the checklist/todos from the active plan file.
- **Strict Comply & Transition**: Follow the todo list item-by-item. Mark tasks as completed (`done`) immediately after completing them, and transition to the next task in the same turn.
- **No Bypass**: Never start editing files, researching, or running commands without first establishing the todo list. This rule takes absolute precedence over all other protocols.

## Key Principles

### Phase Locking

Each mode has strict boundaries:

- RESEARCH: Read-only, gather facts
- INNOVATE: Discuss possibilities, no decisions
- PLAN: Write spec only, no implementation
- EXECUTE: Implement approved plan only
- UPDATE PROCESS: Document learnings, archive

### Safety

- Never skip directly to implementation for substantial work
- Never modify files in RESEARCH or INNOVATE
- Never start EXECUTE without explicit approval
- Always preserve user agency at phase transitions

### System Structure

- **System Structure Reference**: All AI agents and systems MUST read `000_System_Structure.md` at the beginning of a task to understand the exact organization and directories of this Second Brain.
- **Maintain & Update**: Any task that introduces a structural change, creates a new core folder, or deprecates an existing directory MUST immediately update `000_System_Structure.md` to ensure it remains the source of truth.


### Atomic Notes Guidelines

- **Atomic Note Definition**: An atomic note is a highly focused, self-contained piece of knowledge dedicated to **exactly one concept or idea**.
- **Core Constraints for Atomic Notes**:
  - **Single Responsibility**: One note = One idea. If a note starts addressing multiple distinct topics, refactor and split it.
  - **Structured Layout**: Every atomic note MUST follow a consistent structure:
    1. **Frontmatter YAML**: Include `tags` (e.g. `[type/concept, topic/...]`), `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), and `aliases` (Vietnamese and English names).
    2. **TL;DR**: A 2-3 sentence high-level summary at the top.
    3. **Core Concept / Rules / Rationales**: The heart of the note explaining the concept simply with bullet points.
    4. **Concrete Examples**: Short code snippets or practical comparisons.
    5. **Related Notes**: Backlinks (`[[Link]]`) connecting it to other notes (e.g., MOCs or sibling concepts).
  - **Simplification**: Write explanations in a simple, direct, developer-friendly tone (using clear Vietnamese with standard English terms if needed). Avoid copying and pasting large walls of text; synthesize and write in your own words.
### Efficiency

- Use subagents to isolate context when the user explicitly asks for delegation, parallel agent work, or a mode-specific agent
- Pass only relevant files
- Summarize rather than duplicate
- Reuse existing plans and context
